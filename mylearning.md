# This is me documenting my Learning Journey

## What have I learned so far?

During this course I have learned a great deal about Git and GitHub. Some things which I have learned include:

1. **Version Control Basics**: Understanding how to track changes in code over time and the importance of version control for a budding developer.
2. **Branching**: Creating and managing branches to work on features independently.This will come in handy when I want to make changes to my code without affecting the main branch.
3. **Pull Requests**: How to review and merge code changes efficiently.
4. **Markdown Syntax**: Writing clear and structured documentation. I think this will be quite fun to use.

## What I'm Still Confused About.

I would not really say that I am confused but I think getting familiar with the terms and how to use the codes will definitely require a lot of practice but I maintain that I am equal to the task.

## Experimenting with Markdown Styles

Here are some different Markdown styles I've experimented with:

### Bold and Italics

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for highlighting

### Lists

- Unordered list item
  - Nested item
- Another item

1. Ordered list item
2. Second item
